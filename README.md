# GMod
GMod is a multiplatform module playback extension for Game Maker. It's a simple wrapper of the BassMod library, which offers the most accurate module playback for desktop platforms. 
The intention is to make GMod compatible for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

ATM nothing works but expect that to change soon.
